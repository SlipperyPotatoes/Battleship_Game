/** Bot Guessing basic rules
 * 
 * fire in a checkerboard pattern (like black or white squares) do this random so one of the 2 each game
 * 
 * fire at one of the 4 squares in the middle
 * count what ships left depends on ship size left what space you leave in between previous hits
 * 
 * Always focus on sinking a single ship before moving towards other ships
 * Array with what ships are left
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Random version the bot randomly attacks is a checkerboard pattern
